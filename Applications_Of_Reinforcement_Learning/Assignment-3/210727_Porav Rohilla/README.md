# ASSIGNMENT 3

In this assigment we had to do a binary classification of the given dataset.

We were given a train data set which contained the information such as survived or not survived, age, gender, number of siblings or spouse onboard, number of parents or children onboard and tha fare he or she paid. Based on this info we had trained a linear regression model.

This model was then put into the sigmoid(Logistic Regression) funtion to get the logistic regression model.

Then we checked the accuracy of the above trained model using the test data set provided.

Then we estimsted the probabilities of survival of Arpit and Shreya based on the our trained model.
